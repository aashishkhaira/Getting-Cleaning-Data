                              Getting and Cleaning Data: Course Project
Introduction
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

Review criteria 
1.	The submitted data set is tidy.
2.	The Github repo contains the required scripts.
3.	GitHub contains a code book that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.
4.	The README that explains the analysis files is clear and understandable.
5.	The work submitted for this project is the work of the student who submitted it.

About the raw data
For the purposes of this project, the files in the Inertial Signals folders are not used. The files that will be used to load data are listed as follows:
•	test/subject_test.txt
•	test/X_test.txt
•	test/y_test.txt
•	train/subject_train.txt
•	train/X_train.txt
•	train/y_train.txt

About the script and the tidy dataset
1.	Values of Variable Activity consist of data from “Y_train.txt” and “Y_test.txt”
2.	values of Variable Subject consist of data from “subject_train.txt” and subject_test.txt"
3.	Values of Variables Features consist of data from “X_train.txt” and “X_test.txt”
4.	Names of Variables Features come from “features.txt”
5.	levels of Variable Activity come from “activity_labels.txt”
So we will use Activity, Subject and Features as part of descriptive variable names for data in data frame.

About the Code Book
The CODEBOOk.md file explains the transformations performed and the resulting data and variables.
